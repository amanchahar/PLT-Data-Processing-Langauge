				Some ideas to make language better 

1. Maintain HashTables with strings as keys
2. Maintaining FilePointer that contains information like current line number, number of lines read, column number etc. 
3. Leave out regex expressions
4. Maintain String as datatype making data processing easier as primary file types are text files
5. Find and replace functionalities should be implemented 
6. Should contain good support for various printing formats (print $1 $2 )
7.

Doubts: - 

1. Should we introduce constants in language? 
2. Include Error handling and exceptions?
3. Maintain list and arrays as different data structures?
4. Function definition?
5. How to define multi-dimension arrays? Is there a need for creating such data structures?
6. Should we define start and End of programs?





Inbuilt functions: - 

Sort 
split
length
open
substring??
merge??
divide??


keywords: -

if 
else
while
foreach



Some symbols: -


| - Pipe Combining results or Print combine results using , 
@ - Call a function or (@array[12,4,5,2]) to access slice of array
{} expressions - 
$ - refer a variable? like Perl
-> 
>> insert into file directly 
\n
